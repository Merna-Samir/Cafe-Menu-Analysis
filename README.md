# Cafe Menu Analysis

# Descripon

Deciding the items and their prices on a menu card is not an easy task for cafe owners. They
have to constantly analyze their customers’ choices to set the opmum prices of their food
items on the menu. In this project, we aim to analyze a cafe's menu data to draw insights
and help the owners make informed decisions.
We will use a dataset containing informaon on sales, prices, and other relevant features of
the cafe's menu items. We will use this data to verify fundamental economic trends in the
dataset such as analyzing price trends and sales of all the items, sales on special holidays and
weekends, and more such trends. We will draw more insights by visualizing the dataset
through the seaborn library of the Python Programming Language. Another metric that we
will evaluate for this project is the Price Elascity of all cafe items.
